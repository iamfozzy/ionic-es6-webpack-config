# Ionic ES6 Webpack config
This is an example of a webpack config file that can be used with ionic instead of the default gulp build process. Allows using ES6.

Suggested angular app structure:

    /app
      /assets
      /components
      /common
      app.js (entry point)
      app.scss
      app.onrun.js
      app.html
    /www
      index.html (auto-generated by webpack)
      bundle.js (auto-generated by webpack)
